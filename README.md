# laboratory-protocols

## Description
This repository contains markdown files of the protocols in the Jelinski Lab shared drive. They were converted during November 2023. Some files in the Protocols folder are not included here - NRCS-published PDFs, videos, data sheets, videos, et cetera. When possible, example data sheets and other helpful resources were made public and linked within the relevant protocols.

Each protocol was created using the example-template.qmd. Each has a 2-4 word title, separated by hyphens. Photos in protocols are in this repository and named with a short abbreviation for the protocol and numbered in the order in which they appear in the protocol - lpsa3, for example.

As of 08NOV2023, there is one video (amm-ox-setup, both in .mov and .mp4 format) that I haven't been able to embed in its protocol.
