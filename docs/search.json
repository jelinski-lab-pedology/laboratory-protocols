This solution is prepared in two parts. Divide everything here by 5 to only make 2L of this. Solution A: need 1,143mL, make ~1.5L. Solution B: need 857mL, so make ~1L.\n\nSolution A (base): To a 2 L erlenmeyer flask, add the following in order: 1.5 L of RODI water, 42.6 g of ammonium oxalate. Place on stirrer, insert stir bar into solution, and mix until dissolved. \nSolution B (acid): To a 1 L erlenmeyer flask, add the following in order: 1 L of RODI water, 25.2 g of oxalic acid. Place on stirrer, insert stir bar into solution, and mix until dissolved.\nMix 4 parts Solution A with 3 parts Solution B. This requires 1,143 mL of Solution A and 857 mL of Solution B. Math at bottom of document.\n\nI transferred Solution A out of the 2 L erlenmeyer flask into 1 L Nalgenes, then mixed the two solutions in the 2 L flask. \n\nThe resulting ammonium oxalate solution should be pH 3. If not, adjust the pH by adding either more solution A (base) or solution B (acid). Test using pH strips. \nTransfer into and store in polypropylene bottles (Nalgenes).\nDispose of any unused ammonium oxalate solution or oxalic acid in an acid neutralization bucket. It is fine if there is soil in it. \n\nUse pH strips to test the pH of the solution until it reaches 7. To raise the pH, slowly add sodium bicarbonate (powder, in the dry chemicals cabinet). To lower the pH, slowly add an acid, preferably an old one, such as a miscellaneous bottle of 1M HCl. Continually test the pH until it is 7. After that, the solution is safe to put down the drain.",

Make sure that the sample is thoroughly wetted. During the addition, wash sides of the tube and wet the sample. Shaking, swirling, or stirring may be required to wet organic samples. Allow the sample to stand for at least 30 min. Cover samples with black plastic bag to exclude light. \n\nNora added the filter paper, 5mL ammonium oxalate buffer, the sample, then the last 10mL of ammonium oxalate. I rinsed the sides of the ET with the rest of the ammonium oxalate.  \n\nSecure reservoir tube (RT) to top of ET tube. Set extractor for 30-min extraction rate and extract until the ammonium oxalate buffer solution is at a 0.5 to 1.0-cm height above sample. Turn off the extractor. \nAdd 35 mL of ammonium oxalate buffer to the RT. \nCover the extractor with a black plastic bag to exclude light. Adjust the extraction rate for a 12-h extraction. \nAfter the extraction, shut off the extractor. Carefully remove TETOxalate. Leave the rubber tubing on the ET. \nWeigh each syringe containing ammonium oxalate extract to the nearest mg. \nMix extract in each TETOxalate by manually shaking. Fill a disposable tube with the extract solution. This solution is reserved for determinations of Fe, Mn, Al, Si, and P.

    "text": "3.3 Brain Dump\n\n3.3.0.1 Preparation\nMake sure you have all labware washed and ready to go before starting (all syringe tubes, plungers, RTs). After being washed the last time the syringes should have been stored in a clean location so they shouldn’t need to be rinsed again right before using.\nKeep the counter free of clutter. When I’m doing an extraction I typically only have the extractor, two secondary containment trays containing the necessary reagents, and the rack of ICP tubes on the counter. It’s helpful to have plenty of space to put reservoir tubes and extraction tubes when you’re taking them off the extractor between steps.\nIMPORTANT: You will notice that the extractor “spins”. This is awesome. However, the power cord gets wrapped around the machine if you spin it in one direction the whole time. Also, when this happens, the power cord acts like a trip wire for beakers sitting on the counter. Keep your beakers on the containment trays to avoid this, and vary the direction you’re rotating the machine. \nWeighing can happen beforehand if the weighed samples are stored in a safe, dust-free space.\nNOTE: Do not cover a tray of samples with saran wrap. There is too much static and your samples will cling to the plastic. Parchment paper or an upside down bin will work.\n\n\n3.3.0.2 Weighing process\nThis takes me about 1.5 hours.\nSince the analytical balance is in the other room from the extractor, make it easier on yourself and make a tray like in the picture so you can weigh them all at once and then bring them over. \nChoose a random letter that will hold your quality control (Q.C.) sample and which one will be your blank run. Don’t use the same ones each time.\n\nPlace a clean weigh boat on the scale and press “TARE”.\nGently mix the sample in the bag so you have a homogeneous sample.\nUse the scoopula to add soil to the weigh boat until you have near 2.5g. It doesn’t need to be perfect because this number is included in the final CEC calculations.\nRecord weight to the nearest milligram, that is, three places past the decimal. (0.000)\nRemove the weigh boat and place it in an assigned space on the tray.\nRepeat, until 23 samples have been weighed.\n\nUse the “PUSH STICK” to push two circles of filter paper into an ET. Repeat so that there are now four filters in the bottom of the tube.\nPlace ET’s on the extractor by hanging them, tip down, from the top extractor plate.\nUse the NH4OAc spray bottle to wet the filter paper in the ET.\nTap in the soil sample that you assigned to the letter on the ET. Try to get all of it off the weigh boat, which may require a good hard flick.\nAttach corresponding TETNH4OAc to each ET with rubber tubing. Make sure the tubing is creating a good seal with each tube. If one seems too loose, replace it by cutting and installing a new piece of tygon tubing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Tared Extraction Tube\n\n\n\nUse a wash bottle to rinse inside of ET with NH4OAc. All soil should be wetted and no air bubbles. Shaking, swirling, or stirring may be required to wet organic samples. Fill with NH4OAc to 20mL mark. Secure RT to top of ET. Let stand for 30 min. Extract @ 30 min. rate until 2mL remains above soil level (10-20 min). Turn the extractor off. Do not let soil dry. \nNow, there may be soil sticking to the sides of the ET after this extraction. You may need to remove the RT from the ET and wash down the sides again with NH4OAc. This means you will put less NH4OAc in the RT for the next extraction. Just subtract the # of extra milliliters from 40 to determine how many you will put in the RT. In the picture you see the soil level at approximately 3 mL. You’ll want to keep 2 mL NH4OAc above the soil level for all samples, so for this sample you’ll want to keep it at about 5 mL. It looks like 6 mL were added while the soil was being washed down from the sides, so you’ll only add 34 mL (40-6) to the reservoir tube.\nFor the ethanol rinse, first use the ethanol wash bottle to wash any ammonium acetate or soil particles from the sides of the ET. Then use a clean 150mL beaker to fill ET to 20mL mark with ethanol. Place RT on top of ET. Let equilibrate for 30 min. \nExtract at 30 min. rate until 2 mL remains above soil level. Turn off the extractor.\nNow, there may be soil sticking to the sides of the ET after this extraction. You may need to remove the RT from the ET and wash down the sides again with ethanol.

Take the small container and put some acetate in it, this will be referred to as the kill jar.\nTo start, clear the sampling area from loose debris such as leaves and sticks. Place the sample ring in the soil deep enough that liquid would not go out from its sides. Once the ring has been secured, pour about ⅓ to ½ of the mustard water in a circular motion within the ring. Record the time started with mustard. We would like to keep a consistent timeline. Once the liquid all goes down into the soil, add more. The pouring should take 2-3 rounds.\nCollect any worms that may come up and transfer them into the kill jar. When they stop moving they can be transferred into a tube labeled for the site/plot/date and that they came up from mustard. Tweezers are helpful so your fingers don’t have to touch the acetate. When in the tube, fill until it is over the worms to ~10mL of the 70% ethanol.\nWhen the mustard water has been fully drained, record the time, lay down the tarp next the the ring, and start digging within the ring. Try to keep the soil layers organized like top soil further from the ring and the bottom closer to the ring. That way, the hand sorting can be brought back to its original layer at the end. Dig to 12 inches in depth. Worms that are half in the hold and half out count as in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nScrape the sides to make sure we get the full area. Worms really like clumps and root masses.\n\n\n\nHand sort the soil to pull any worms that appear. As collecting put them into the kill jar. This gets really muddy. Slowly put the soil back into the hole. Try to clean the worms in the kill jar to get as much of the soil off as you can. Place them into a tube labeled site/plot/date and hand sort. When in the tube, fill until it is over the worms to ~10mL of the 70% ethanol. Dump the waste acetate soil into the waste container. Use the extra water to do a quick rinse of the soil off of the tray/container so it’s ready for the next plot.",

As they get clean, place the worm back into the original container until they are all in there.\nFill the tube with the ethanol ~5-10mL over the worms. If any ethanol hits the side of the tube the label may smear off. Take the paper towel to dry off the tube and relabel when it’s dry, which is almost instantly. Once sample is cleaned put it off to the side with the other clean samples.\nThe waste from that sample can go into the bigger beaker.

Then, take the cap off of a Falcon tube, place the tube in the stand and TARE it on the scale. Gently mix the soil in the bag to make a homogenous sample. Weigh 0.75g (+/- 0.02) of &lt;2-mm fine-grind, air-dry soil sample and record to the nearest mg (0.000).\n\nMove to the fume hood\n\nIn the fume hood, add 0.4g Sodium Dithionite to each Falcon tube using a level pinch scoop (pic).\nPour some 0.57 M Sodium Citrate into a triple-rinsed beaker or flask.\nUse a 25 mL bulb pipette to add 25mL sodium citrate to each Falcon tube.\nMake sure all tubes are tightly capped. Shake briefly by hand or with the Vortexer to dislodge soil from the bottom (I count to 8 when using the Vortexer).\n\n**Leave the fume hood**\n\nPlace them in the shaker overnight. Use Styrofoam and/or duct tape to secure the tubes in place so they don’t roll around. (See pic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDon’t let the duct tape contact your labels on the tubes because it will pull the labels right off.\n\n\n\nRemove tubes from shaker and manually shake tubes to dislodge any soil from cap. Allow samples to sit overnight.\nThe following day, centrifuge at 3800 rpm for 15 min.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNOTE: The centrifuge must be balanced or it will shake the shelf apart. If you have an odd number of samples you need to create a “balance tube” that has a similar amount of soil and liquid in it. Also, see pics for proper loading arrangements.\nIf you’re going to leave the lab while you are waiting for the centrifuge, stay in the room until the centrifuge is all the way up to speed to make sure it is balanced before you leave. Nic has a great story about a toolbox nearly falling off the shelf.\n\n\n\nCarefully remove each tube from the centrifuge and place in a rack. Check each sample to see if it has flocculated (There should be no cloudiness or “wispies” rising from the surface of the soil pellet. Color in the extract is okay, but cloudiness is not). See pics.\nIf you notice that a sample has not flocculated properly, add 10mL of  ___ sodium chloride and then centrifuge again.\n\nAgain, if you have an odd number of samples to re-centrifuge, make a balance tube.\n\nIf samples are properly flocculated, use an automatic pipettor to extract 10 mL from the tube. Extract slowly, and gently move the pipette tip around, up and down within the extract to obtain a representative sample. Be careful not to get too close to the surface of the soil pellet. Inject extract into a labeled ICP tube.\nIf there are organic particles sucked into the pipette, use a funnel and 47mm Whatman filter paper to filter the extract into the ICP tube. Filtering:\n\nFold a filter paper in half, and then in half again.\nPlace the quarter circle in the funnel, point down.\nUse the pipette tip (pipette should now contain extract) to gently open up the filter paper and keep it in place as you release some of the extractant.\nUse the pipette tip to carefully manipulate the filter paper if needed. Don’t get too rough because the filters tear easily when wet.\n\nStore at 4 degrees C (in lab fridge) if the extracts won’t be immediately sent to the RAL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Centrifuge loading; credit: Eppendorf Handling Solutions",

If prepping samples in the morning, shake them in the afternoon if possible. If prepping samples in the afternoon, shake them the following morning before running them in the afternoon, if possible.\n\n\n\n9.2.0.2 Calibrating the EC Reader\n\nRemove the cap from the EC probe.\nDip probe in 84µS solution. Allow value to stabilize.\nPress cal/meas to enter calibration mode. Use the up/down arrows to calibrate to correct value. Press enter to save the calibration.\nAfter a moment the top right corner should stop flashing “CAL” and should switch to “MEAS” when ready to measure again. Rinse the probe with DDI water and dry with a Kim wipe.\nRepeat with the other 4 solutions, rinsing and drying the probe between each.\n\n\n\n9.2.0.3 Measuring EC\n\nVortex the sample for 30-60 seconds, shake upside down to disperse the sample from the bottom. \nTake reading and record.

The reader may switch to ms but report value in µS. If the value is under 10.0, it’s probably reading in ms.\nThe stock bottles of calibration solution are located in the dry chemicals cabinet. Rinsing the probe in between each calibration is critical for ensuring that the calibration solutions do not mix and continue reading the same values. However, the calibration solutions do have to be switched out occasionally.",

    "text": "10.2 Sample Preparation Procedure\n\nPulverize air dried sample with a pestle and mortr and pass through a 2mm sieve.\nAlso acceptable to pulverize oven dried samples, but they left out to likely absorbed moisture from the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWearing a face mask while pulverizing is recommended. Note that all of the sample may not pass through the sieve, do not crush the coarse fragments to force them through. You can hear the pestle hitting coarse fragments – it makes a different sound (louder and sharper). Stop pulverizing when you hear this and sieve the soil that is pulverized.\n\n\n\nCollect and remove the coarse fragments that do not pass the 2mm sieve as they are not used in the texture analysis.\n\nYou may note what percentage of coarse fragments is in the sample, their size, shape, hardness and mineralogy. This is data that can be useful, though is not necessary for this texture analysis.\n\nPrepare to measure 30-50g of the dried and pulverized soil sample by gently mixing the closed bag of soil so that it is as homogenous as possible. Gravity fractionates the particles, with smaller particles settling out to the bottom of the bag. Do your best to obtain a representative sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOne way to mix the sample is to hold the closed side of the bag in one hand and the bottom in the other, and mix it upside down, roll it side to side, rolling it around.\n\n\n\nWeigh 30-50g using the 2-digit analytical balance. Tare the weight of the Nalgene bottle, add and measure the weight of the dry soil. Document the weight of the soil and the sample name on the bottle as well as in your lab book just in case the mixing process wears some of that information off the bottle.\nAdd precisely 100 ml 5% SHMP to each bottle then add ~70ml DI water or until the bottle is no more than ¾ full.\n\nThere needs to be enough room for the slurry to slosh back and forth while laying on the side of the bottle in the mixer.\n\nPrepare a blank mixture in another Nalgene with 100ml 5% SMHP and DI water at the same time as you are prepping the other samples to ensure you will use the same mixture of SHMP that you prepared the soil slurries with. Prepare a blank each time you prepare a set of samples.\nTighten the lids of the bottles and vigorously shake each so that all soil comes free from the bottom of the bottle.\n\nThis is a good time to ensure that the lids are secure.\n\nLay the bottles on their sides in the basket on the mixer and set it at ~30 RMP.\n\nSmaller bottles may need to be mixed at a higher rate to get the necessary sloshing action. This sloshing action with the SHMP is what disaggregates the aggregated particles.\nMix for at least 8 hours (or overnight). Longer is no problem.",

Remember to also rinse the sediment on the Nalgene lid into the column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOne technique to get the last bits out of the bottle is to hold the Nalgene bottle upside down above the column and spray the DI up into and onto the sides of the bottle. While doing this, rotate the Nalgene around. The particles stuck on the shoulder of the bottle should be flushed out by the water flowing down and out of the upside down bottle.\n\n\n\nFill all columns precisely to 1L with DI water.\n\nRoom temp DI water should be used from a carboy. I find the building DI water from the faucet is a warmer temp. If DI water is taken from the faucet to fill the columns, provide time to let it acclimate to room temp (a day).\n\nPrepare the blank column with the blank from the Nalgene bottle.

Plan accordingly!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBe sure to document the time that each sample is begun at. Keeping a running stopwatch (on a phone) is one method. Document the start time of each sample (0 min, 4 min, 8 min, etc). 3 or 4 minutes between each sample is good spacing. - 40 Second: The first reading measures the total of silt and clay, combined. At 40 seconds, the sands will have fallen and dropped out of the solution. - 4 Hour: This is an additional reading – verify if this reading is needed or not. - 8 Hours: This reading measures suspended clay. Sands and silts will have fallen out.\n\n\n\nRecord the temperature of the mixed blank solution. Mixing instructions follow:\nWhile holding the column with one hand to stabilize it, vigorously mix with the plunger. Settled silt and clay particles may form a cake on the bottom, so look closely that there is not a layer of sediment still stuck at the bottom as you plunge.\n\nBe sure to gently lift and mix the sample all the way to the upper half of the column too; don’t just mix in the lower portion of the column. Try to get the sediment in column as homogenized as possible.\n\nAt the moment you remove the plunger from the surface of the sample, time begins at 0 seconds. Start a stopwatch and keep a record of the time started. Soon thereafter, gently lower the hydrometer into the sample, and gradually release your grip until you find where bobbing is minimal. At the time of 40 seconds your hydrometer should be floating steady. Take the reading from the top-most level of the liquid where it rises up and onto the hydrometer – read the liquid level.\n\nRead where the top of the water line rises up on the side of the hydrometer. Read to the nearest whole number or round to a half if need be. Not less than a half number.\n\nAdd another drop or two of amyl alcohol after inserting the hydrometer to eliminate foam on the surface in the sedimentation column. The foam makes it difficult to read the liquid level on the hydrometer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Reading a Hydrometer\n\n\n\n\nGently take the hydrometer out and rinse it and the plunger with DI water before beginning the next sample.\n\nConsider laying down a towel next to your columns so you can rinse onto that instead of going back and forth to the sink.\n\nA reading should also be taken from the blank at the respective time, after mixing. The blank should read 5, meaning 5 g/L (100 ml of 5% SHMP was used in the blank from the 1 L mixture you made having 50 g SHMP added.)\n\nIf this reading is off, know that room temperature is a variable that can affect this. When and if adjustment is needed, add 0.4 g/L for each degree above 20 degrees Celsius or subtract 0.4 g/L for each degree below 20 degrees C.\n\nThe second/third reading will occur 4.0 and/or 8.0 hours after the start. No mixing or plunging will be done as this measurement will measure the total clay suspended, or how much silt has dropped out during the settling period. Again, gently insert the hydrometer as to not drop it, minimizing how much it bobs. Read from the top of the liquid level and document.",

    "section": "11.2 Sample Preparation Procedure",
    "text": "11.2 Sample Preparation Procedure\n\n11.2.0.1 General Principles\nAt all steps of sample preparation and sample measurement, utmost care must be taken to avoid fractionation. This means that the best possible representative subsamples must be taken from the sample bags, and once the subsample is being prepared, none should be lost: - The entire subsample should be transferred into the preparation container (we have currently been using 30 mL Nalgenes) - No liquid should be lost from the preparation container (it is likely that this liquid would contain fine clays at the very least, which could fractionate the sample - The entire contents of the preparation container (liquid and all particles) should be transferred into the measurement beaker through thorough washing with dissolved water. - No water should be allowed to overflow from the measurement beaker. If any of the above are suspected to occur, the sample may be fractionated. In severe cases, the results should be considered invalid. In uncertain cases, notes should be made in the sample logbook or in the sample entry itself so that if results are significantly different than other subsamples the underlying reason can be backtraced.\n\n\n11.2.0.2 Procedure\n\nQuantitatively (i.e. don’t lose any sample) transfer a representative subsample of ~ 0.48 – 0.52 grams into a 30 mL Nalgene container. Note: it is more important here to get a representative subsample than an exact mass (i.e. don’t take a little material out or put a little more material in just to make the mass – take one representative scoop and go with it unless it is far outside of the target range).\n\nWe have been using the pinch scoop with red tape on the handle to achieve a representative sample.\nConsider shaking or turning the container the sample is in prior to removing your subsample, as heavier particles may have settled to the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\nPinch scoop\n\n\n\nPrepare 3 independent subsamples as described in step 1 for each soil sample that will be run. Label the bottles with the sample name, and subsample # (i.e. 1-3).\n\nAlternatively, prepare 1 bottle of each sample and a duplicate of every 10 samples. Make note if there are any sampling errors and create a second replication as needed. Before doing this, ensure that it is sufficient for the project.\n\n\n \n\nTransfer 5 ml of 5% (50g/L) SHMP into the container using a pipette. Transfer 5 mL of bleach into the container; if soil is an O horizon you may put in more bleach. Fill to ~ 20 ml total volume with DI water (this does not need to be quantitative, just ~ 2/3 full – the key is that there is enough room left in the bottle for adequate movement when on the shaker).\n\nDo not use low-splash bleach (see photo).\n\n\n  \n\nPlace on shaker at around 30,000 rpm for 12-24 hours (more is okay if necessary but should be relatively consistent time).\n\n\n\n11.2.0.3 Other Potential Pretreatments\nPretreatments under development include: - Organic matter removal (addition of ~ 2 + ml of 30% H2O2 after shaking/dispersion). - Carbonate removal (addition of ~ 2 + ml of 2M HCl after shaking/dispersion). - Just practiced adding HCL before bleach and shaking. Let effervesce overnight and then SLOWLY put in bleach and shake. Add slowly because it can overflow if the HCl hasn’t reacted fully. - Water-dispersible clay only: In this treatment, no SHMP is added. DI water is the only thing used as dispersant. This is an estimate of aggregate stability and the behavior of soil aggregates – but do note that these soils have already been hand pulverized. - Iron oxide removal",

    "text": "11.3 Particle Size Analysis Procedure\n\nStartup sequence: It is critical that these steps are followed exactly to allow the software to run as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nTurn on computer.\nTurn on LPSA.\nWait at least 20-30 minutes.\nOpen Malvern Software\n\nDuring the 20-30 minutes that the LPA is warming up, ensure your samples are grouped by names and organized by numbers. Example, under group Waseca: samples 1, 2, 3, …n. Also, obtain four 600 mL beakers.\n\n\n\n\nExample setup\n\n\n\nStart the computer and click on “MASTERSIZER 3000” icon on the screen.\nOpen the “MANUAL MEASUREMENT” located at the top of the computer screen and wait for the “NEW MEASUREMENT” file to open\nIf the “MANUAL MEASUREMENT” button is grayed out, unplug and replug the USB marked with red on the computer tower.\nYou should see three green bars at the bottom of the window: Extended Software, Can 1: Hydro EV, and Mastersizer 3000. This means the Mastersizer, blender, and computer are communicating. See photo below.\n\n\n\n\nThree green bars\n\n\n\nUnder the file name, write the date the experiment is being performed and your initials, eg 23JUN2015_JBL.\nFill the 1000 mL beaker with DI water up to the 800 mL mark and place it in the wet dispensing unit (Hydro SV).\nUnder the “Sample Identification” in your screen, write the name of the soil sample to be experimented followed by the bottle number and your initials. Example: C-UFS-2-P-#1_JBL. Click ‘OK’.\n\n \n\nClick on the “INITIALISE INSTRUMENT” that is highlighted on the screen and allow the system to run for about 5 seconds.\n\n \n\nClick on the “MEASURE SAMPLE” to begin measurement of the sample. The system should automatically record three measurements and stop.\n\nBelow is an example of what a “good” reading would look like. All three lines are relatively straight. If one (the red line, usually) looks like a large mountain or deep valley, make note of that in your spreadsheet and potentially rescan it.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample acceptable reading\n\n\n\nRemove the beaker from the unit and dump it in the drain. Rinse the beaker and fill it with DI water.\nFill one 500 mL beaker with DI water up to the 400 mL mark and place it in the unit and allow it to run for about 30 seconds to clean the LPSA. Repeat the procedure 3 times and as needed to ensure that all the soil particles in the system are completely out. Note that coarse sand particles will tend to get trapped in the sample lines and may take a long time to remove. Watch for this especially on very coarse samples.\nExit the file and this completes the first measurement for the sample #1.\nPlace the 1000 mL beaker with the DI water and click on the “INITIALIZE INSTRUMENT” and follow the steps for the second measurement. Repeat until all samples are finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile running samples, when closing out the measurement window, the computer will sometimes think you clicked twice and ask if you want to close the Malvern software altogether - “do you want to save the changes to measurement file xxx?” Click cancel to avoid closing the software and potentially losing your data.\n\n\n\n\n\nCloseout window\n\n\n\n11.3.0.1 Cleaning the LPSA\nAfter you are finished using the laser particle size analyzer, it is important to remove any residual particles from the tubes/machine. Sand particles are most often the ones that get stuck. - After the last sample, rinse the LPSA 3 times with DI water, just as has been done with the previous samples. - Fill one 500 mL beaker with DI water and add 1-2 squirts of soap mix from the bottle labeled “Dilute Soap Water.” Rinse the LPSA with this solution. - Fill one 500 mL beaker with DI water up to the 400 mL mark; rinse the LPSA with this solution. - Leave the unit/blender head up when finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe recommend dumping at least the first rinse between each sample into a 5 gallon bucket next to the Mastersizer, rather than filling up the sink’s catch bucket quickly. Dump the 5 gallon bucket into a toilet when you are finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo clean the 30 mL Nalgenes, rinse them (lids and bottles) out very well - I use the S434 sink, but the dishwashing sink also works - and set them upside down to dry on a tray with a paper towel below.\n\n\n \n\n\n11.3.0.2 Exporting data from the LPSA/Computer\n\nUnder the “Home” menu on the top of the screen in the Malvern Software, choose “Export selected records” or “Export all records.”\n\nTo select only certain records to export, hold the “control” key on the keyboard and select each record you wish to export. Once each record you want to export is highlighted in blue, select “Export selected records.”\n\nOnce the “Export Data” window opens, you will be able to change the formatting of your exported file.\n\nOrdering: can choose between rows or columns.\nDelimiter: this changes what separates each cell or piece of data. You can choose between comma or tab delimited.\nFormatting: can choose between formatting the data as it’s displayed in the software which displays numeric information to a limited number of decimal places (this may be preferable for presentation purposes); or choose unformatted values to show all data as recorded by the system. For most uses of the Mastersizer, choose unformatted values.\nHeader: can choose between “header on” and “header off”. “Header on” keeps headings like “Record Number” and “Sample Name.” For most uses of the Mastersizer, leave the header on. Once the settings are correct, select “Export to file” at the bottom of the window. You can choose between Text files (.txt), CSV files (comma separated values; .csv), or All files (.). For most uses of the LPSA, select “CSV files.”\n\nSave the file to the desktop.\n\n\n\n11.3.0.3 Shutdown Sequence for the LPSA/Computer\nIt is critical that these steps are followed exactly to allow the software to run as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nClose Malvern Software.\nTurn off LPSA.\nLog off computer or set it to sleep.",

    "text": "12.2 Procedure\n\nPrepare laboratory notebook with the following data columns:\n\nSample number, crucible number, oven dry (OD) crucible (g), pre-muffle crucible+soil (g), post-muffle crucible+soil (g)\n\nA few samples will be used for calculating a moisture correction. See below. Data columns:\n\nCrucible number, OD crucible (g), air dry moisture correction soil +OD crucible (g), OD moisture correction soil + OD crucible\n\nRinse the crucibles with DI water and place them in drying oven at 105 degrees Celsius overnight (or 6-8 hours).\nTake the crucibles out of the oven and place them into the desiccator where they can cool for a couple minutes. Your cooling time (such as 5 minutes) should become a standard for all samples in your set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe 4-digit analytical balance does not like hot items, so the crucibles must cool down before weighing. Cool to the touch is fine. When hot items are placed onto the scale, the air and metals in the scale expand and the scale gets wonky. It ends up reading a negative value when the items are removed from the scale. So, I placed the crucibles from the oven into a desiccator because I felt that the oven dry crucibles gained water weight from the moisture in the air while sitting out in the lab. I wanted to keep them as dry as possible to reduce the chance that such gained moisture weight wouldn’t be inaccurately counted as soil weight.\n\n\n\nWeigh each crucible on the 4-digit analytical balance; record the OD weight and the number of the crucible.\nDo not tare the weight of the crucible. Gently mix the soil around in the bag so that you have a homogenous sample, and add ~5 g soil into the crucible with a small scoop.\nDocument OD crucible + soil weight (g).\nPlace the crucible and soil onto the ceramic plate that will be slid into the muffle furnace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome folks make a map of which crucibles are on the plate, but I chose to document the number of the crucible and which sample was placed into that numbered crucible in my lab book. I did have to lift the crucible up high to see the number on the bottom when I went to weigh it. Perhaps a combination of both listing the crucible number and using a layout map would be useful for identifying the samples when they are taken out of the furnace to weigh.\n\n\n\nWipe off the scoop and repeat the weighing procedure. Complete this soil measurement and weighing process for the chosen number of samples you will do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI recommend 12-18 samples at a time. More of the smaller crucibles can fit into the muffle furnace on the ceramic plate, but the small crucibles are more challenging to pick up (you should use the tongs, trying to grab it with oven mitts on is probably not possible to do). Also, 5 g of an organic sample will not fit into a small crucible. If you fill the ceramic plate that slides into the muffle furnace with too many crucibles, you risk having crucibles sliding/falling off the edge –which means a loss of your sample and its data.\n\n\n\nNote that the temperature of the muffle furnace has warmed to 550º C. Load the ceramic plate and slide it into the muffle furnace. Close and latch the door and let the samples bake for exactly 5 hours.\nAfter 5 hours, turn the furnace off and crack the door open to allow some heat to escape for 5-10 minutes.\nCarefully remove the samples from the muffle furnace. Be careful. Either place them in the drying oven or into the desiccator to cool some before weighing them. Don’t let them sit out at room temperature because they will absorb moisture from the air. If you leave them in the desiccator, be sure to crack the lid or rubber stopper to avoid a pressure inconsistency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you don’t crack the lid, the desiccator will suck in air when you open it and sample will fly everywhere.\n\n\n\nTaking one sample out of the desiccator at a time, weigh each sample shortly after it has cooled to the touch (5 minutes, or same amount of time afterward as before when you let the crucibles sit after being in the drying oven).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWatch out - the weight of the sample will increase the longer it is exposed to the air as the soil particles are absorbing moisture. Take the first reading you see, that is, when you feel that scale is balanced after the sample is set onto it.",

Repeat until the sample chamber is completely immersed in the soil and the soil surface is even with the bottom of the wider metal circle.\nCarefully remove the sample chamber from the soil. For sandy soils, it’s a good idea to do this while kneeling and with your hand close to the hole to quickly cover the open end of the sample chamber if needed.\nFlip the tool upside down and unscrew the sample chamber.\nRemove the plastic sleeve from the chamber.\nUse a flat edge to remove soil above the top of the tube. Be careful to not compress the soil in the tub while doing this.\nCap the tube and either use tape to label with sample information or place in a pre-weighed and labeled paper bag.\n\n\n\n15.2.0.2 In Lab\n\nPrepare laboratory notebook with the following data columns:\n\nDate, sample name, time into oven, field moist weight with plastic bag (g), weight of plastic (field) bag (g)1, net field moist weight (g), oven dry weight with paper bag (g), weight of paper bag (g)2, net oven dry soil weight (g)2\n\n1 - not needed if using plastic sample tubes\n2 - if the paper bag weight is negligible – omit the last two measurements noted with “2” and use Oven Dry weight with paper bag (g) in the calculation instead of net Oven Dry weight.\n\nRegarding both net weights (field moist and oven dry) - this can be calculated in Excel or R. Not necessary to have a column in the paper data sheet\n\nAs soon as possible, measure the field moist weight of each sample.\n\nIf the sample is in a plastic tube, transfer it to a pre-weighed and labeled paper bag. Before transferring, check that there are no holes in the corners of the bags (which occasionally happens when the bags are manufactured)\nWeigh the sample and paper bag. This is the gross weight.\n\nPlace the samples in the drying oven at 50ºC. The exact temperature is not critical; if the temperature is lower, the samples will take longer to dry - that is fine.\nDry the sample for at least 48 hours. Be consistent in dry time for all samples.\nWhen the samples are completely dry, measure the oven dried weight of each sample. The weight of each sample should be taken as soon as possible after the sample is removed from the oven because moisture will be absorbed from the air immediately.\n\nYou will realize this when you see the weight on the scale ticking up and up each second. Only remove a few samples from the oven at a time to weigh.",

    "text": "16.2 Preparation\n\nFor accurate calculations, the soil (and pycnometers!) should be oven-dried; otherwise a moisture correction will need to be applied to the weight of the soil. I found that it was time efficient to measure out the soil samples at the same time that you are degassing the water.\nPut a large flask (½ full with DI water) on a hot/stir plate and connect it to the lab bench vacuum with tygon tubing. The size of the flask can vary depending on how many samples you are running. A XXX ml flask worked well for me for ~60 samples - you don’t end up using too much of it.\nPut a stir rod in the flask and turn the stir setting to 5 while also turning the heat setting on 5. Turn the vacuum on and put a rubber stopper over the opening of the flask (this will become pressurized, so don’t put it on too tight).\nMonitor the bubbles in the water of the flask - the water is degassed when NO bubbles can be seen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote, the water may not come to a complete boil, and that’s okay. The heat speeds up the process regardless. This process usually takes 2.5-3 hours. Once no bubbles can be seen in the water or on the stir rod, turn off the hot plate and let the flask cool overnight. Turn off the vacuum, but don’t take the tubing or rubber stopper off - this should help to keep air out overnight.\n\n\n\nWhile waiting for the water, you can measure out ~2 g of soil from each sample into a small metal weighing tin. Since there are only 30 pycnometers, it’s only possible to run 30 samples in a day; and I found that 15 at a time is a good number to have on the hot plate.\nRecord the sample ID and weigh tin number (see the blank data sheet folder for a template) for each sample and put them in the oven (at 105C) at least overnight.\nIn summary, the night before you plan on running the samples, degassed water should be cooling to room temp, and you should have all your soil samples AND pycnometers drying in the oven.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKey Points - Water should always be de-gassed the same day you are running the samples. Letting it sit for even a few hours adds oxygen back in. - Always double check you are using the correct stopper with the matching pycnometer (they will have the same number on them). The exact weight and volume of each pyc. differs, and the final particle density numbers are super sensitive to these values. -Each time you record the weight of the pycnometer, the stopper should be included.",

    "text": "16.3 Procedure\n\nReturning to your now-room temp, degassed water, turn the stir setting back on 5 to get rid of any oxygen that has entered the flask overnight. It usually takes ~40 minutes to get rid of all the bubbles again. Do NOT turn the heat back on, you need this water to remain at room temperature. Once the bubbles are gone, remove the flask from the stir plate and pour (carefully, so as to not create more bubbles) into a squeezable water container with a small dispenser.\nWhile this happens, take your soil samples and pycnometers out of the oven and place in a desiccator til they are cool to the touch (about 10 minutes). Measuring them while too hot will mess with the analytical balance.\nFor each sample, weigh the dry pycnometer by itself, and then again with the 2 g of soil. Record both of these weights, along with the pycnometer number (this will be very important later). The metal weigh tins come in handy here, since you can fold them to pour the soil in the pyc. without making too much of a mess.\nOnce each pyc has soil in it, use DI water to fill the pyc halfway to its neck. Filling the pyc much higher risks bubbling over while boiling. Stir each sample to make sure all of the soil is saturated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA note for different textures: coarse textures/sands will pop when heated, put less water in these samples to prevent loss of soil; for organics - 2 g of soil hardly fits in the 10 ml pyc, the most important thing is to not fill the pyc more than ½ way full (regardless if this amounts to &lt;1 g of soil). The organics will also soak up a lot of the water (after mixing - which you will have to do a lot of for these samples) and you may need to add more before placing on the hot plate. Just make sure there is standing water in these samples that is able to boil.\n\n\n\nArrange 15 pyc on the hot plate so that they can be rearranged. Remove all the stoppers. There will probably be a hotter part of the plate that makes some samples boil faster, make sure each sample gets a chance to heat in this spot. Turn the hot plate to heat setting 4.\nMake sure each sample comes to a rolling boil for 1-2 minutes, and continue to rearrange accordingly. Stir frequently to release air bubbles trapped in soil and to reduce some boiling. A straightened paper clip works well for stirring and moving the pycnometers around.\nTotal boiling time takes ~20-30 minutes, including 10+ minutes for the first sample to start boiling. After all the samples have boiled, turn off the hot plate and move the pycnometers to the desiccator. Let cool for approximately 40 minutes or until room temp. If possible, try to weigh the samples when the solution is ~26C (this is the temp that the pyc volumes were weighed at).\nEach pycnometer needs to be filled completely with degassed water after cooling. Remove the stopper and slowly fill the pyc to ~¾ of the way up the neck. Then, place the stopper back on and make sure the water reaches the very top of the capillary. Water can spill over the top and come out the space between the pyc and stopper - this nearly unavoidable. Use kimwipes to clean up any water that spilled out (soak up the water at the top of the pyc first, this will draw down the water in the capillary). Make sure the outside of the pycnometer is totally dry before weighing.\nRecord the weight of the pycnometer with soil and water, along with the temperature at time of weighing.",

    "text": "17.2 Procedure\n\nIncubator/shaker should be prepped and set to 39ºC upstairs in Borlaug Hall prior to starting bio-prep.\nMaking 0.4M glycine solution: Triple rinse with DDI water a 1000mL volumetric flask, stir bar and extractor, 1000mL container with lid, and funnel (if preferred). Weigh 30.028 grams of Glycine. Fill flask about 60% full with DDI water, then place onto a stir/hot plate. Slightly warm the water before pouring the weighed out glycine into a flask. Once the solution has dissolved into the water, turn off heat. Once the solution has cooled down, take off of the plate, remove the stir bar, and fill the volumetric to 1000mL container.\nAfter preheating and adjusting glycine, prep all soil samples in new, acid washed, or DI triple rinsed Nalgene bottles. Use roughly 1g of &lt;250um sieved soil. Weigh on analytic scale and record exact soil weight used (will be used later to calc bio-percentage). Use a small scoop to put soil in bottles and start with the lowest lead content sample and move up to the highest lead content sample. Wipe the scoop with a kim wipe.\nGlycine prep: Glycine solution should be prepared to 0.4M and adjusted to roughly 2.55 pH and 37ºC before bio run (adjust pH initially a little high just in case temp adjustment changes it.) I normally use at least 800mL glycine for bio runs so it is less volatile to change; ~100ml per sample. I normally use a stir bar and hot plate along with pH meter to determine pH and temp. Be sure not to overheat. Use oven if required. The 0.4M glycine solution starts roughly at pH 6, so when adjusting, start with ~75 mL of 6M HCl and then add drops as needed.\nAfter prepping all the soil in bottles, heat up the glycine solution to 37ºC on a stir/hot plate. Check pH before adding to soil bottles. Add exactly 100mL of preheated pH 2.5 glycine to each bottle and cap. Bottles should already be labeled. I would use one new syringe for all samples and inject into a 100mL volumetric to make sure the amount of glycine is as close to 100mL as possible. Record times of exactly when the glycine went into the bottles with soil. Place bottle in a cooler to help sustain the warm temp in transportation.\nBring samples upstairs and secure them in the incubator. Shake for 60 minutes. You can remove a couple samples halfway and check their pHs and temps with the pH meter to ensure things are staying within parameters but I’ve never noticed a significant change.\nAfter 60 min, use a new syringe for each sample to extract enough solution to fill an ICP tube. Collect the sample in the syringe, place a new filter on the tip and then inject the solution into the ICP tube and filter soil. Place in the fridge if they can’t be immediately dropped off at the lab for analysis. Test the pH of ~2 samples at the end to ensure that the samples stayed within the parameters (2.45-2.55).\nWhen dropping off at the lab for analysis, they are considered Special (white labeled). On the sheet, make sure to include samples for Pb analysis (ICP), 0.4M glycine matrix, and let them know that it is the same as submitted Special #018 FY 17/18. Provided Nic’s information and your own email for the results.\nTrace HCl plasma pure to 6M HCl: The trace HCl plasma pure is 12M, so this is just a 50/50 ratio with DDI water. Make sure all tools used are triple rinsed with DDI water. Take precautions for HCl/acid handling. A funnel is HIGHLY recommended.",

    "text": "18.2 Procedure\n\nWeigh wet samples in the field (field wet weight).\nDry at 35ºC (95ºF), moving wet samples to 55-60ºC (130-140ºF) dryers as needed. Transfer wet samples in the hot dryer for up to 8 hours at a time.\n\nTo protect the baggies, put them on pieces of cardboard when they’re in the dryers; this also makes it easier to transport the samples between the hot and warm dryers. Cardboard can be found in the cardboard dumpster on the south end of the Seed Barn. Rip boxes into trays that would fit on the dryer racks.\nFold the top of the bags down halfway so there is a wider opening (see left photo on next page). If there is a lot of sample around the top of the bag, don’t fold it at all because the sample will fall out as it dries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nSeptember is a busy time for the dryers, so the ones in Crops Research were very full. Use the Seed Barn dryers instead.\nIt’s helpful to put the samples on different trays according to moisture level as you are opening them, meaning separate the very wet ones from the less wet ones. That way, you have an idea of which trays need to go to the hot dryers and which can be taken out first.\nI checked on the samples every day, both to move them to the hot dryers and mix up the samples. They will dry faster if you move the sample around; squish it from the outside of the bag, pull the bag away from it, pull the sample out from the corners of the bag, etc.\nIt’s more manageable to take the dry samples out on a rolling basis, so consider checking on the more dry trays every couple days. Remove any dry ones and weigh them, so you’re not stuck doing several hundred on the same day.\nAs mentioned above, the drying process will go a lot faster if you move the wet samples to the hot dryers (140ºF) daily. I started by leaving them in there for 4 hours at a time to make sure the bags wouldn’t bake, but 8 hours is fine. The cardboard and bags will be slightly warm when you remove them, but not hot enough to burn.\n\nIn Sep/Oct2023, we left them in the 140ºF dryer for the entire drying process and the bags were fine.\n\nA couple last logistical notes: to make your life better, turn the fans off before you open the dryer doors. The buttons are under the stairs on the first floor of the seed barn (to the right of dryer #3). Remember to turn the fans back on! Also make sure that the dryer doors are fully latched, as some have tricky handles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.1: Sample in ziploc bag; note that bag is folded over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.2: Samples loaded in dryer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHere’s what the samples should look like in the dryer. As you can see, they are all on cardboard trays and the bags are folded open. Baggies do not need to be spaced out, but make sure they are open at the top so air can get in.\n\n\n\nWeigh samples when dry. The sample can stay in the bag(s) if you know the average bag weight. If you’re sieving right after weighing the samples, weigh them in a weigh boat.\nPulverize and sieve samples to 2mm. Save coarse fragments (&gt; 2mm) in a 2x3” or 4x6” bag if there is a significant amount. We want to keep any gravel and rocks. While sieving, consider preparing the samples for pH, EC, and LPSA. After taking the &lt; 2mm weight of the sample and putting it back in the bag, measure out the necessary amounts into pre-labeled containers.\n\npH/EC: 10g of sample (fill to 10mL line) in a falcon tube\nAnalysis at lab (RAL, Agvise): minimum of 5g in a 2x3” bag. Note that organic soils weigh significantly less and 5g will not fit in a small bag - just fill the bag.\nLPSA: 1 pinch of sample (use pinch measuring spoon w/ red tape on handle) in a 30mL Nalgene\n\nOnce prepared for all analyses, the reserve sample should be stored in a large tote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConsider printing out labels to tape on the bottles so you don’t have to write them individually on tape. I made a spreadsheet and wrote each label twice (one for pH/EC and one for LPSA). Prep pH and EC in the same falcon tube.\n\n\n\n18.2.0.1 Loss on Ignition (notes)\nThe following section contains notes and thoughts for LOI on permafrost samples. In 2022 and 2023, we have not done LOI.\n\n[directions on cleaning and drying crucibles? Is that only done after LOI. Can we just use the crucibles as they are, assuming they’re clean?]\nOn the analytical balance, weigh a clean, dry, empty ceramic crucible. Record the weight. Do not tare the scale after placing the crucible on it.\nMeasure 5g of air dry sample into the crucible. Somewhere between 4.8-5.2g of sample is good. Record the weight of your crucible and soil sample together.\nOven dry samples for 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe muffle furnace can hold 12 samples at a time. Consider preparing samples and putting them in the oven on the morning of day 1. On day 2, once 24 hours have passed, remove them from the oven, weigh them, and put them in the muffle furnace. Remove them before you leave on day 2.\n[maybe add notes about preparing and oven drying 24 samples and working a longer day on day 2 to have time to put 2 rounds of 12 samples through the muffle furnace?]\n[is it important that samples go from the oven to muffle furnace quickly? Can they sit out for a few hours/a day in between or will they reabsorb moisture?]\n\n\n\n\nOn the analytical balance, weigh your crucible and sample once again (dry).\nTransfer crucibles and samples into the muffle furnace @ 450/500ºC for 4.5-5 hours.\nWeigh the crucible and sample again on the analytical balance. Samples will be very hot upon removal from the muffle furnace. Use tongs to remove.\n[do the samples get added back to the bag after LOI? Kept separately?]\nRinse, clean, and oven dry the crucibles for the next round.",

    "text": "19.2 Procedure\n\nPreparing 0.02M CaCl2: 110.978 g/M x 0.02M/1 L = 2.22 g/L or 2.22 g CaCl2 / 1L H2O\n\n\n19.2.0.1 Sample Preparation (in 50mL Falcon tube)\n\nPlace ~10 g of the soil sample into the Falcon tube. Or fill to the 10 mL line.\nAdd 10 mL of DDI water. For consistency, use the small plastic 10mL graduated cylinder. This pH method is a 1:1 (DDI:soil) ratio. For organic soils, do 2:1, with 20 mL DDI water. Document which samples have a 2:1 vs 1:1 ratio.\nCover with lid and shake/mix it vigorously and thoroughly for 30-60 seconds. You can also use the Vortex mixer.\nPrepare 8-10 samples, spaced out each 4 minutes.\nAllow the samples to stand for one hour, but shake each sample for 30-60 seconds once every 20 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n(shake at 0 minutes, 20 minutes, 40 minutes, 60 minutes then measure pH)\nYou could make a chart to keep track of which samples are to be shaken when. Ideally, each sample marinates for approximately 60 minutes. Try to stay away from the situation where the first 3 samples rest for 60 minutes, the next three for 70 minutes, the next three 80 minutes, etc. To avoid this, I found doing a run of 6-8, with each spaced 4 minutes apart worked well. You can start the next group of 6-8 samples within the same hour, as long as you can keep track of which need to be mixed when. A chart I drafted before beginning worked well for me, and I checked off which I had shaken at each interval as I went along.\n\n\n\nDuring the 1-hour marinating period, make sure the pH meter is turned on and standardized. The meter does not have to be standardized each time, but should be checked for proper calibration before and after each set of samples.\n\n\n\n19.2.0.2 Calibrating the Electrode\n\nHave buffers available with pH 4.01, 7.00, and 10.01. Gently shake each buffer sample so it is mixed.\nWith the pH meter on, press the calibrate button and insert the electrode into the pH 4.01 buffer solution. The meter might recognize the pH of the solution and would change the reading to 4.01. If it does this, press the calibrate button again to move on to the second calibration. The screen will read CAL.2 at the bottom.\nIf the meter does not recognize the solution as pH 4.01, you will have to change it manually. Press the digits button (see the diagram below) to edit the reading and the up/down arrows to change the numbers. Make sure the decimal is in the right spot!\nOnce the meter screen reads CAL.2, rinse off the electrode with DDI water, dry, and insert into the pH 7.00 buffer solution. Repeat the process as outlined above. When the screen reads 7.00, press the calibrate button to move to the third calibration (CAL.3).\nIf you only need a two-step calibration (pH 4 and 7), press the measure button to complete the calibration.\nOnce the screen reads CAL.3, follow the same process with the pH 10.01 buffer solution. When done, press the measure button to complete the calibration. The screen will show the slope of the calibration curve before continuing to read the pH.\n\nNote: we are not currently calibrating with pH 10.01 buffer, just 4 and 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.1: pH meter keypad\n\n\n\n\n\n19.2.0.3 Measuring pH\n\nShake the sample for the last time at time 60 minutes before inserting the pH electrode.\nRinse the electrode with DDI and wipe it gently with a Kim wipe.\nInsert the electrode at the same depth for each sample. You can place a piece of tape on the upper part of the electrode that you can use such that it lines up with the tope of each tube (for example).\nTake the pH reading exactly 60 seconds after the last mixing, or when the pH stabilizes.\nRemove the electrode and rinse it, with DDI, rinsing into a beaker to collect dirty rinse water.\nAdd 10 mL of 0.02M CaCl2 to the soil slurry.\nShake vigorously for 30-60 seconds\nInsert pH electrode and take the second pH reading at exactly 60 seconds (or when the pH stabilizes).\nRinse the electrode with DDI water into the designated beaker.\nGently wipe/dry the electrode stem and dab its end with a Kim wipe before beginning the next sample.\nRepeat the process for the samples you prepared.\nWhen you are finished with the set of samples, test the buffers to verify that the pH meter is still calibrated properly. This should be done often. It only takes a moment.\nIf you are finished for the day, press the “stdby” button on the meter to put it in standby (sleep) mode. It will still be standardized the next time you return. As the screen will tell you, hit stdby to resume. You should check the calibration by measuring the buffer solutions – plus or minus 0.1 from pH 4/7/10 is okay. More than that and you should recalibrate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nElectrode storage – IT IS ESSENTIAL to place the electrode in DDI water, either immersed in a small beaker of DDI water or place the electrode into the storage bottle which is filled with clean DDI water.",

    "text": "Column of blank with 100ml SHMP\n\nFill to 1 L with DI water. The room temperature will be taken from this blank. You also likely used this blank in the hydrometer run. If you have prepared a new blank – this column should have sat in the same room as the other columns so that it has the same temperature as all the columns. The reason I mention this is because the building DI water is warmer than room temp; therefore, it should be allowed to acclimate to room temperature; overnight is best.\n\nSedimentation columns\n\nFor post hydrometer for testing. For each run, the maximum is probably 8 columns (including the blank). I’d recommend 4-5 columns per run for beginners, working up to 8 columns per run for advanced pipetters.\n\nExtra column\n\nFilled with DI for rinse. This can be filled higher than the 1L mark. This is not for measurements, just for rinsing the pipette between samples.\n\n400mL beaker\n\nTo catch “dirty” rinse water. Set this inside the rinse column, then the pipette bar doesn’t have to be moved, just the pipette swiveled to where the rinse water can drop down into the beaker.\n\nTins, Oven Dry (OD)\n\nTins should have been in the oven overnight (4-6 hours) so that they are oven dry. I think it’s best not to use tins that are dry but sitting out, room temp, because of the slight moisture they absorb.\n\nOven dry tin weight\n\nAfter taking the tins out of the oven, place them in the desiccator. After 2-3 minutes they are cool to the touch and can be weighed. I found that leaving all the tins in the desiccator and taking one out at a time works well. With the direrite in the desiccator, little moisture can be absorbed by the tins.\n\nColumn mixer/ plunger\n\nAs the columns sit after the wet sieving, the sediment can start to collect and form a cake to the bottom. You will have to plunge quite strongly to get this sediment to be suspended. Firmly hold the column with one hand so it is sturdy, plunge with the other hand.\n\nTimer\n\nKeep track of the time you start each sample. You will take the first pipette measurement after approximately 4 ½ mins (for the 20 micrometer particle) and then after 4 ½ hours (or after the period you choose for the 2 micrometer particle). These times are specifically written in the master book on page 62 & 63. If you choose a 4 ½ hour reading, for example, continue this same time of reading for all samples you do, even if they are taken during future runs.",

    "text": "20.2 Procedure\n\nPrepare laboratory notebook with the following data columns:\n\nSample ID\nTemperature of Blank\nTime of start: minutes and seconds. I use the stopwatch on my phone and let it run, recording what time I take the plunger out – such as 00:00 (minutes:seconds), then 07:00 (for the second test)\nTin # being used\nOven Dry tin weight (tin pulled from desiccator)\nWet weight (sample + tin)\nDried Sample + tin oven dry weight: this sample will be placed in the desiccator for 2-3 minutes to cool and then should be weighed directly from the desiccator to minimize moisture it can absorb from the air. Note – when you take this weight on the 4-digit balance, the weight will increase steadily due to moisture absorption – so take the first stable weight you see.\n\n\n\n20.2.0.1 Pre-Procedure Thoughts\n\nPractice the procedure with the column of rinse water before starting. This gets the vacuum pressure and your technique just right. With the vacuum and hose, the pipette will require about ~12 seconds to fill.\nThis is important: Do not let the sample get up into the bulb – a bubble that forms underneath can trap some of your sample from being released.\nDouble and triple check that the vacuum hose is disconnected before turning the knob to release your sample. You do not want your sample to escape upward into the hose if the vacuum is still on.\nSet up your columns so that the pipette is lowered in the center of the column as opposed to the edge next to the glass. You won’t want to move the sedimentation columns once you start.\nUse weight boats to cover the samples you are not working. Best not to lets drips fall into them (contamination).\nSet the vacuum so that the black lines are lined up with each other.\n\n\n\n20.2.0.2 First Reading: 20 micrometer particle\nUsing the book and the temperature of the blank, you will learn what the first time of your pipette will occur. The 20-micrometer reading will always be at 10cm, but at a varying time from the end of the mixing (depending on the temperature taken from the blank). This 10 cm level needs to be set on the pipette. The measuring tool goes from zero on the bottom and upward to 10. The movable measuring bar/stopper gets set at the 10.0 line. Not all the way to the top, that is more than 10.0 cm. If this isn’t clear, take a extra moment to look at the way the measuring tool is designed.\n\nReady – plunge! All sediment needs to be suspended. Carefully, but firmly mix. Use two hands - one to hold the column and one to plunge. When the plunger is taken out of the column, this is time = 0. Wait the 4 minutes and some seconds (according to the temperature and the reading in the book p.62)\nAs you are waiting this 4 and some minutes, weigh the tin you recently removed from the oven and placed into the desiccator. Record the tin number and it’s oven dry weight.\nWhen time is near to pull the first sample, make sure the vacuum is turned on, the hose is disconnected, the white knob on the pipette is CLOSED. With the 10 cm setting, lower the pipette apparatus so that the end tip of the pipette just touches the surface of the liquid in the column. Lower the pipette the 10 cm preset measurement.\nAt the time your measurement is due attach the hose then open the knob. Hopefully you have practiced with clean DI water so that you have the vacuum pressure set correctly - approx. 12 seconds for the pipette to draw the sample to the line.\nStop by closing the knob, then pull off the hose from the vacuum nozzle. Leave the vacuum on and set to the correct pressure you’ve determined. You will not need to turn the vacuum off. The hose goes on and off, but the white knob is most important for your control. This starts and stops the pipette from drawing your sample.\nWith the hose off the vacuum (double check this) swivel the pipette and release the sample into your oven dry tin. Take the weight on the 4-digit scale immediately at the soonest you can, as evaporation is happening. If the sample is stable on the scale, take the first weight you feel is accurate, yet the weight will continuously be decreasing (due to the evaporation). Now that you have the weight, it’s ok to leave it sitting until you have all your samples to put into the oven for your 24 hours oven dry.\nRinse once or twice between each sample\nComplete the run of all your samples.\nTins with wet sample can be put into the oven to dry 24 hours (105 degrees C, with the plug on the oven top so it is closed).\n\n\n\n20.2.0.3 Second Reading: 2.0 micrometer particle\nThis is very similar to the initial procedure, but this time the depth of measurement will be the variable, dependent on the time you chose and the current temperature of the blank. If you select the 4 ½ hour time, you will continue this throughout all of the sample runs you do. Your depth of reading will be found on page 63, under the 2.0-micrometer page. It will probably be 5.7cm or something similar. This is the depth from the surface of the suspension. The measurement bar is measured from the bottom to the top.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe trick with this reading is that the pipette won’t swivel from sample to sample because the columns are too tall. Each time the glass pipette is above a sample column, you will have to set the depth of reading. This can be a little tricky. After you have pulled the sample, you will have to raise the measuring bar and raise the pipette all of the way. Then the pipette tip is clear to swivel.\n\n\n\nAgain, tins should be pulled from the oven and into a desiccator. They should be able to cool before they are weighed on the 4-digit scale. I like to weigh the tin just before I use it. I choose not to let them sit out as I feel they take on some weight of moisture, which then alters the measurement.\nYou will take the same volume of measurement for the second reading.\nYou can also take a sample from the blank on the second reading.\n\n\n\n20.2.0.4 Post oven: oven dry weight\n\nRemove samples from the drying oven and place them into a desiccator for 2-3 minutes to cool to touch.\nWeight them individually on the 4-digit balance and record the sample’s weight.\nYou will use the pipette data along with hydrometer and sand fraction data to complete the particle size analysis for your sample. Nic has an electronic spreadsheet for this.",

If there is enough support, it is also helpful to have one person writing down the results, so the pXRF operator is just scanning. We have not had success exporting data from the pXRF onto a flash drive or computer. There is a cord in the pXRF supplies drawer in S434. Theoretically, exporting from the pXRF is similar to that on the computer; in the results section, choose export today, and the software creates a .csv. However, we cannot find the file on devices. For this reason, we recommend writing down the results during operation (especially if lead, for example, is the only element of interest), or taking a photo of the results screen for each sample.",

    "text": "22.2 Procedure\n\nThe day before sieving, weigh a well represented soil sample to ~ 50 grams. Does not need to be precise, more important to get a mixture of the sample. Weigh the sample into a 250mL nalgene bottle with 100mL SHMP.\nMake sure all the caps are closed and put them in the shaker overnight (~6-12 hrs).\n\nYour soil sample will be wet sieved and all sand can be oven dried in one tin, the silt and clay will be in the sedimentation column. The sands need to be clean, so that no silt and clay is dried with the sands or the drying process can leave you with a puck as opposed to single grain sands. Sands can then be dry sieved and weighed in individual fractions.\n\nAn efficient wet sieving technique is necessary so that less than 1L of water is used, as that is all that will fit into the sedimentation column. One technique is to run the shaken soil sample through the finest sieve while it sits in a plastic funnel that sits atop the sedimentation column.\nAnother technique is to start in a weighboat. The finest sieve will be useful, completely saturated with DI water prior to starting the sieving. Pour the sample through the sieve in 2-4 parts. Use a DI rinse bottle (with a fine nozzle, to conserve DI water) to help rinse the silt & clay through the sieve and rinse the sands. Some tapping or shaking the sieve is also helpful to get things to move through.\nThe sand left in the sieve can be carefully emptied into a weigh boat so that the sands don’t clog the sieve for the next part you pour through. You may want to back rinse (rinse from the back side of the sieve) and rotate it while rinsing.\nSo, after the Nalgene you mixed your soil sample with the 100mL SHMP is emptied through the sieve (remember to rinse the lid into the sieve too!), rinse all sands from the weigh boat back into the sieve and finish rinsing with DI water. You really want the rinse water coming through the sieve to run as clear as possible. This is tricky to achieve without using more than 1L DI water, so use it sparingly at first. Good luck.",

    "text": "Update 3.0 February 2024\n\nIn addition to all general laboratory safety modules, all pXRF users must have completed the 1) Radiation Safety Orientation and 2) Radiation Safety for Radioactive Material Users. These modules can be found at the HSRM Training website.\nAll pXRF users must have a currently valid dosimeter, requested from and registered by HSRM. Dosimeters are kept in the drawer labeled pXRF supplies.\nAll pXRF users must wear their dosimeter on a body area closest to the pXRF instrument at all times when handling or utilizing the pXRF.\nAll other personnel who will be within 6ft of the pXRF unit while in use must also abide by guidelines 1-3. If a person will be within 6ft of the pXRF while in use and has not satisfied guidelines 1-3, pXRF operations must STOP IMMEDIATELY!\nAll pXRF users must have completed unit specific training by reading 8-10 (Safety portion) of user manual as well as unit specific operation and maintenance training from Dr. Jelinski.\nWhen handling the pXRF, ALWAYS ASSUME IT IS ON! This is called “muzzle awareness”. Never point the pXRF at any person or cross the plane of a persons body, even if you believe the pXRF is off. Instead, point the pXRF at the ground when moving it.\nThe only safe and verified way to handle the pXRF for maintenance or preventive checks is to REMOVE THE BATTERY and leave the battery portal open so that all personnel can visibly confirm that there is no battery in the unit.\nIf at any time the beam won’t turn off, or you are concerned about operation, REMOVE THE BATTERY.",
