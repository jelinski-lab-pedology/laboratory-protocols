We are testing 3 methods in one: an initial reading after 30 mins, one before the end of the day (\~ 6 hrs), and one that stands overnight. Modified from NRCS KSSL Laboratory Methods Manual; see references.

## Materials

-   EC reader
-   D.D.I water (double deionized water, filtered campus DI water)
-   Squeeze bottle of DDI
-   Falcon Tubes, 50mL

## Procedure

-   Test calibration; see EC protocol.
-   Put soil in Falcon Tube to the 10 mL line.
-   Add 10 mL of D.D.I water to sample using a squeeze bottle.
-   Vortex for roughly 30s and let sit for 30 mins. Record time, take a reading.
    -   Reading technique should be similar as pH, probe in at the same depth every time. Be mindful of the notation on the reader when recording
-   Add 10 mL of DDI water, let sit for approximately 6 hrs, swirl/agitate/hand shake, record time, take a reading.
-   Let sit for 24 hours (from the initial start time), swirl/agitate/handshake, and take a reading.

## Calculations

-   No calculations are required for this procedure.

-   Use the following relationship to estimate the total soluble cation or anion concentration (meq L−1) in the soil. EC (mmhos cm−1)x10=Cation or Anion (meq L−1)

-   Use the following relationship to estimate the total soluble cation or anion concentration (meq g−1 oven-dry soil) in the soil. EC (mmhos cm−1)x20=Cation (meq g−1 soil) EC (mmhos cm−1)x20=Anion (meq g−1 soil)

-   Report prediction conductance to the nearest 0.01 mmhos cm−1 (dS m−1).
