This is not a full protocol yet, just notes. Nora will build on it.

## Preparation

-   Air dry, pulverize, and sieve samples to 2mm

-   Label 125mL Erlenmeyer flasks with sample codes; measure 5g soil into each. We did not use the analytical balance for this. This can be done ahead of time!

-   Use Whatman #4 filter paper to cut wicks; Gaby has a piece of laminated square grid paper to get each piece to be 0.5x0.5in (I believe that is the measurement). Tightly roll each into a wick

    -   Each sample needs 2 wicks (one for AgNO3, one for soil solution); if doing duplicates of each sample, each needs 4 wicks

-   Count out one #4 filter paper for each sample; poke a tiny hole in the middle for the wick to go in and label with pencil

    -   Hole should be 1/16 inches in diameter; Gaby has a good tool for this

    -   Make one small pencil mark ~~1.5~~ inches from the center and one ~~2 ⅜~~ inches from the center of each filter paper \[edit: update these measurements for 18.5cm; 15cm filters should be used\]

-   Make **0.5% AgNO3** solution. Should be stored in a brown bottle and not exposed to light

    -   0.5% solution = 5g AgNO3 / 1L H2O → 2.5g / 0.5 L → **1.25g / 250mL**

    -   Reasoning: 1L = 1000mL and the density of water is 1g/L, so there are 1000g/1L. 10% by weight would be 100g/1L, 1% would be 100g/1L, 1% would be 10g/1L, and 0.5% would be 5g/1L. Checked with Gaby 03MAY2023

    -   This does not need to be made on on a stirrer; AgNO3 is H2O soluble

-   Make **1% NaOH** solution

    -   Using the extra pure solution (50% NaOH by weight), **add 20mL solution per 1L H2O**

    -   We need to dilute the 50% NaOH solution 50 times

    -   CAS: 1310-73-2. Kept in flammable liquid storage cabinet underneath fume hood in S434. Because it's a liquid, just mix them in 1L Nalgene bottles.

-   Set out one large petri dish and one small one for each sample

    Are you processing foreign soils? Tape off a counter and have plenty of ethanol/bleach spray. Trash should go in an autoclave waste bag, not in a trash can

## Procedure

-   5g soil in Erlenmeyer flask → each gets 50mL 1% NaOH. Do not add until doing procedure
-   After NaOH is added, thoroughly mix the sample by swirling the flask. Swirl for 6 rotations, repeating 6 times, for 36 total rotations.
-   Let flasks stand undisturbed for 15 minutes. Repeat the swirling process.
-   Let flasks stand for 1 hour. Repeat the swirling process.
-   After samples are swirled, let sit for 5 more hours. After the 6th hour (including hour in step above; 6 total hours), then chromatography can begin.
    -   Do not disturb the flasks at all during the resting period.
-   Saturate filter papers with AgNO3 to first line, using the large/small petri dish and wick setup.
-   Once saturated, they must dry completely with no light exposure. Consider making a sandwich with 1 piece printer paper, 1 paper towel, 1 filter paper, 1 paper towel, and 1 piece printer paper. See photo below. Store in a closed box.

## Post-Procedure

-   Samples should dry on a bench for 3 hours, then get hung in a window

-   Nora gently attached a paper clip to each filter paper, then taped the paper clip to the window. Didn't want to risk ripping the filter paper when taking the tape off

-   Chromas should develop in the window for 7-8 days. Window should not get direct sunlight, although a little bit seems to be fine

-   Chromas should be scanned on a high quality scanner (UIC or SWAC printer?) within 1-2 days of being fully developed

-   Store chromas with a sheet of paper in between each
